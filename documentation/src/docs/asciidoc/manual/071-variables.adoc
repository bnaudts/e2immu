=== Statement analysis

There is one `StatementAnalysis` object per statement, so a method consists of a chain of statements.

=== Variables

Types of variables:

* fields, in 4 flavours: effectively final, variable, undecided in the first iteration(s), and acting as local variables in synchronized blocks
* parameters, non-assignable
* local variables
* `this`, `super`
* dependent variables, like the cells in an array

For each variable, we store its value, a map of properties, and an object flow.

Eventual destinations of properties, values, object flows:

|===
| fields | `FieldAnalysis`
| parameters | `ParameterAnalysis`
| `this`, `super` | `TypeAnalysis`
| return value of method | `MethodAnalysis`, `singleValue`
|===

During statement analysis, the maps in `StatementAnalysis` hold values and properties for all types of variables.
These maps are incremental: once the analyser writes a value, it cannot remove the key anymore; it can only increase this value.

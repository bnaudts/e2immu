== Abstract

The {e2immu} project combines strong opinions of how to write good Java code, with a set of annotations, a static code analyser, and support code such as editor highlighting tools and an annotation server.
Together these concepts and tools aim to help Java engineers write code that is more readable, more consistently structured, and lasts longer.

In large software projects, immutability is an important concept with numerous benefits.
In object oriented languages, immutability never received the attention that in gets in functional languages.

However, immutability is too strong a concept for many situations.
Many complex objects undergo a long construction phase before they are in their final state.

By introducing a number of annotations that imply content modification, or the absence thereof, the {e2immu} code analyser can compute if, or when and where, a class is effectively content immutable.

=== Code blocks E2Immu

We’re at the beginning and there is a lot of work.

. Analyser.
Focus on:
.. Correctness + completeness, able to run own code -- *primary concern*
.. Extension of standard analyser features (`@Size` is good example).
Showing that we're on par with SonarQube and IntelliJ. -- *not all needed but good to improve code*
.. Analysis of type usage and data paths -- *not yet started*
.. Eventual immutability. Needs the previous point  -- *not yet started*
... support for Spring
... support for Vertx.io (`@NotNull1`, `@NotNull2`)
.. Annotation of libraries
... Via IntelliJ -- *to investigate*
... Via Annotated API files -- *started*
... By inspecting them via the analyser -- *need better analyser first*
... Translation of JetBrains annotations -- *need a lot more*
.. build library of equivalent constructs -- *critical for many objectives below*
.. Colouring of code + educational aspect
.. Rewriting of code + flexibility aspect
.. Prediction of code constructs
.. Duplication checking
.. Duplicate fragment detection with heuristic methods
.. Work towards valuable code analyser
.. Work towards code metrics -- *probably not interested in this*
.. Code translation to idiomatic Kotlin, Scala, …
.. Large scale code modernising, e.g., move Java 4 code to Java 14
. Editor plugins
.. IntelliJ  -- *started*
.. Eclipse
.. Language server protocol, Visual Studio Code
.. Eclipse Che (RedHat OpenShift). Pretty good as a web editor on OpenShift. Can take VS plugins (like sonarlint).
.. AWS Cloud9 IDE
. Editor support server
.. Tomcat -- *vertx.io, started*
.. Lambda + AWS DynamoDB
. Project management
.. file
.. Vaadin app, deploy in AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Very useful for eventual immutability.
. CI/CD
.. Gradle plugin for command line analyser
.. Gradle plugin for Lambda analyser
.. Lambda for partial code analysis
.. many other CI/CD systems
. Extensive test suite
. Manual, explanation *started*
. Book, motivational text *started*
. Website *Hugo*

== Contracts

Annotating an interface like we did in the previous section allows the user to explicitly state that implementations must follow certain immutability rules.
This is very important.
While it may be commonly understood that an `equals` call will not cause modifications, the `e2immu` system will simply forbid overriding the `equals` method in a modifying way.

The analyser's rule system is very strict with respect to visibility modifiers.
If for some reason certain fields must be non-private outside the user's control, a contract annotation can always override the result of the analyser's computation.
Example:

[source,java]
----

See IntelliJ JetBrains contract system.

Annotating libraries: you only have to do the interfaces.

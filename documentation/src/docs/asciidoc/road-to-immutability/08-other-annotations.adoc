== Other annotations

The {e2immu} project defines a whole host of annotations complementary to the ones required for immutability.


=== Nullable, not null


=== Identity and fluent



=== Extensions

Static classes can be used to 'extend' closed types, as promoted by the Xtend project.
Level 2 immutable classes can also play the role of extension facilitators, with the additional benefit of having some immutable data to be used as a context.

=== Utility class


// ensure a newline at the end

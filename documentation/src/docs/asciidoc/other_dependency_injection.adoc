== Other dependency injection frameworks

SonarQube will warn against injection on fields
https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-3306?search=final
but can `e2immu` can easily make this work (again).

[#dagger-dependency-injection]
=== Dagger dependency injection

The https://dagger.dev/users-guide[Dagger 2 Framework] provides dependency injection using JSR-330 annotations.
We plan to compute eventually final and eventually immutable classes.

Dagger's multi-bindings allow for the creation of sets using dependency injection: here we can move from
(eventually) final to eventually immutable sets.

Dagger's producer extensions allow for asynchronous dependency injection using futures, much in the same way
that <<vertx-integration>> does.
